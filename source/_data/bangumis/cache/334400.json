To stop anybody from getting the Talismans again, Jackie destroys them with a powerful laser cannon. However, this merely releases the powers held within which then relocate to the Twelve Noble Animals - restarting the Talisman hunt from season 1, only now they must compete with Daolon Wong who has now transformed the enforcers into his Dark Chi Warriors after Uncle imprisoned his original set. The Chans must find and secure each animal gifted with their ancestor's power before Wong can attain the powers for himself.","rating":{"rank":859,"total":817,"count":{"1":2,"2":0,"3":0,"4":4,"5":14,"6":74,"7":301,"8":321,"9":58,"10":43},"score":7.5},"updated_at":"2024-08-14T16:12:35+08:00"}
